# Navigation Intent Detection

You are analyzing user input to determine if they want to navigate to a specific area of the Chief of Staff application.

**projects** - Project and task management interface
- User wants to see, review, or manage their projects
- User is asking about tasks, to-dos, or project status

**contacts** - Network and contact management
- User wants to see their contacts or address book

## Instructions

Analyze the user's input and determine:

1. **Does the user want to navigate somewhere?** (yes/no)
2. **If yes, which area?** (inbox/emails/projects/profile/contacts)

## Response Format

Return a JSON object with:
```json
{
  "wants_navigation": boolean,
  "target": "area_name" or null,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}
```

## Examples

**Navigation-Only Requests (wants_navigation: true):**

**User:** "take me to my emails" / "go to emails" / "I want to review my emails"
```json
{
  "wants_navigation": true,
  "target": "emails",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "User wants to navigate to emails area"
}
```

**User:** "let me see my projects" / "go to projects"
```json
{
  "wants_navigation": true,
  "target": "projects", 
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "User wants to navigate to projects area"
}
```

**Non-Navigation Requests (wants_navigation: false):**

**User:** "what emails do I have?" / "show me my recent emails"
```json
{
  "wants_navigation": false,
  "target": null,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "User wants email content/data, not navigation to emails area"
}
```

**User:** "what's the weather like?"
```json
{
  "wants_navigation": false,
  "target": null,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "User is asking for information, not requesting navigation"
}
```

Focus on the user's **intent** rather than specific keywords. Consider context and natural language patterns.
